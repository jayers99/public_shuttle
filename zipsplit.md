To zip up a directory on a Mac and set the maximum file size for each zip file to 25 MB, you can use the Terminal. MacOS Terminal allows you to use the `zip` command with various options to create split zip archives, where each segment is of a specific size. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Open Terminal**: You can find Terminal in Applications under the Utilities folder, or you can search for it using Spotlight.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Use the `cd` command to change to the directory that contains the folder you want to zip. For example, if your folder is located in your Documents, you'd type:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents
   ```

3. **Use the zip command with split size option**: The command to create a split zip archive with a maximum file size looks like this:
   ```bash
   zip -r -s 25m output_zip_name.zip folder_to_zip/
   ```
   - `zip` is the command to create the archive.
   - `-r` tells zip to recurse into directories.
   - `-s 25m` sets the maximum size of each split archive to 25 MB. Replace `25m` with another value if you wish to use a different size.
   - `output_zip_name.zip` is the name of the output zip file.
   - `folder_to_zip/` is the directory you want to compress. Replace this with the actual name of your directory.

4. **Execute the Command**: After entering the command, press Enter. The Terminal will start the compression process, and you'll see the split zip files named like `output_zip_name.zip`, `output_zip_name.z01`, `output_zip_name.z02`, etc., depending on the total size of the directory and the number of parts needed.

5. **Check the Output**: Once the process completes, you can check the folder for the split zip files. Each file except possibly the last one should be around 25 MB in size.

This method is useful for breaking down large file archives into smaller, more manageable pieces, especially when dealing with file size limits for email attachments or uploads.
